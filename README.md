## URL Shortening

The service includes a built-in URL shortening feature that uses 4-character hexadecimal IDs. Short URLs follow the pattern `/ln/{id}` where `{id}` is a 1-4 character hex string (0-9, a-f).

### Usage Examples

- `/ln/a1b2` ‚Üí Redirects to Google
- `/ln/04ac` ‚Üí Redirects to peppoj.net

### Managing Short URLs

URL mappings are configured in the `urlMappings` constant within the worker code. To add new short URLs:

1. Use the provided utility script to generate unique hex IDs:

   ```bash
   node generate_hex_id.js https://example.com
   ```

2. Copy the generated mapping to the `urlMappings` constant in `ip_worker.ts`

3. Redeploy the worker

The system supports up to 65,536 unique short URLs (hex range 0000-ffff).
